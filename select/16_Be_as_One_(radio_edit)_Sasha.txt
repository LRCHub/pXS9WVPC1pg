In my heart, In my head
There's a place that only we can ever know
It is there that we meet
We can share ourselves and let our feelings show
So I sleep and I dream
Of turning crystal raindrops into snow
There I wait for your kiss
When you breathe life you breathe it back into me

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

If you think that you would go to fast
I would be there to slow you down
If you tumble, if you dive
Get back up to stay alive
We got to keep our love
We got to keep our love

You give me, the love that I need
Lifting me up to the light
To bring me back down to your paradise
I can see, you in me
I got you inside and enough, is never, never too much too much for me

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

If we can find a way to be as one
Then we would never be lonely
If you believe in me
Be your one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one

Be as one
Feel as one
Breathe as one
Love as one
